# Caesar
#### A program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher
The secrecy of this “cryptosystem” relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you’re perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!

Here’s how the program work if the user provides a key of 7 and a plaintext of hello, world

# Example
```
$ ./caesar 7
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: olssv, dvysk
```
### Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.
